<meta name=twitter:title content="Grokking the System Design Interview - Learn Interactively"><meta name=description content="System design questions have become a standard part of the software engineering interview process. Performance in these interviews reflects upon your ability to work with complex systems and translates into the position and salary the interviewing company offers you. Most engineers struggle with the system design interview (SDI), partly because of their lack of experience in developing large-scale systems and partly because of the unstructured nature of SDIs. Even engineers who’ve some experience building such systems aren't comfortable with these interviews, mainly due to the open-ended nature of design problems that don't have a standard answer.This course is a complete guide to master the SDIs. It is created by hiring managers who’ve been working at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. We've carefully chosen a set of questions that have not only been repeatedly asked at top companies, but also provide a thorough experience to handle any system design problem.Let’s get started!">
